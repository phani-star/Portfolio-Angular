      bio: "I'm a backend-focused Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, and system architecture. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems, with hands-on experience in RESTful APIs, microservices, and database design. Currently working as a Jr.Software Engineer at Cognizant, I've contributed to enterprise-grade applications across domains like energy and travel, modernizing legacy systems and ensuring seamless deployments. I believe in writing clean, testable code and have consistently achieved high code coverage through JUnit and Mockito. While backend is my core strength, I use AI-assisted tools to streamline frontend development and deliver complete solutions. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through logic, performance optimization, and smart integrations.Outside of work, I enjoy playing cricket and volleyball—activities that keep me energized, focused, and always ready for the next challenge.",
      goals: "My career goal is to continue growing as a full-stack developer, taking on challenging projects that allow me to contribute across the entire software development lifecycle. I am passionate about learning new technologies and leveraging them to solve real-world problems.",
